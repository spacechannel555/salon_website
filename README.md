# Natural Look Aveda Salon Website (Local Setup)

## Prerequisites
- PHP 8+ with `mysqli` enabled
- MySQL 8+ (or MariaDB) and access to create/import databases
- Composer (for PHPMailer)

## 1) Get the code
Place this folder on your machine (e.g., `website_zip.zip`).

## 2) Install PHP dependencies
From the project root:
```bash
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

## 3) Create and seed the database
1. Create a database named `booking_sys`.
2. Import the schema/data:
   - phpMyAdmin: choose `booking_sys`, go to Import, upload `booking_sys.sql`, and run.
   - CLI: `mysql -u <user> -p booking_sys < booking_sys.sql`

## 4) Configure credentials
- Database: update the host/user/password/db name in `config.php` and `database.php` to match your local MySQL account.
- SMTP (optional for email notifications): in `config.php`, set your SMTP host, port, username, and an app password (Gmail requires an app password when 2FA is on). If you don’t need email locally, leave SMTP as-is; booking will still work.

## 5) Run the app
From the project root:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` for the public pages. The booking/auth pages are PHP (e.g., `booking_login.php`, `booking_register.php`, `dashboard.php`).

## 6) Test accounts
Sample users are seeded in `booking_sys.sql`, but the passwords are hashed. Easiest path: register a new account via `booking_register.php`, or update a user’s `password_hash` directly in the database with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` hashes generated by PHP.

## Troubleshooting
- `Class "PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer" not found`: run `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`.
- DB connection errors: confirm MySQL is running and the credentials in `config.php`/`database.php` match your local setup.
- Port already in use: run PHP on a different port, e.g., `php -S localhost:8080`.
